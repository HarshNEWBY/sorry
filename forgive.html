    <p> It truly means more to me than I can explain.
I know I hurt you, and I’m really sorry for that.
Your forgiveness shows how kind and big-hearted you are, and I promise I won’t take it lightly.

I don’t want to just say sorry —
I want to prove it with my actions, with my care, and with the way I treat you every day.

Thank you for choosing us again.
Thank you for trusting me again.
And thank you for loving me even when I make mistakes.

I love you, and I’ll do better. Always. 💗
